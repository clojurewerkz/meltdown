# Meltdown, a Clojure Interface to Reactor

Meltdown is a Clojure interface to [Reactor](https://github.com/reactor), an asynchronous
programming, event passing and stream processing toolkit for the JVM.

It follows the path of
[Romulan](https://github.com/clojurewerkz/romulan), an old
ClojureWerkz project on top of LMAX Disruptor that's not currently
actively being worked on.


## Project Goals

 * Provide a convenient, reasonably idiomatic Clojure API for Reactor
 * Not introduce a lot of overhead
 * Be well documented
 * Be well tested


## Community

Meltdown uses
[Reactor mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/reactor-framework/). Feel
free to join it and ask any questions you may have.


To subscribe for announcements of releases, important changes and so on,
please follow [@ClojureWerkz](https://twitter.com/#!/clojurewerkz) on
Twitter.



## Project Maturity

Meltdown is **young**, although the API hasn't changed
for quite a while. However, as Reactor itself changes rapidly, breaking
API changes are not out of the question.

## Documentation

### Basic concepts

`Reactor` is a message passing library, that's used to tie events and
handlers together. Handlers can be attached to and detached from reactor
dynamically. When handler is attached to reactor, selector is
used. Selectors is a way for reactor to know when to call a handler.

First thing you need to get started is to define a reactor:

```clj
(ns my-ns
  (:require [clojurewerkz.meltdown.reactor :as mr]
            [clojurewerkz.meltdown.selectors :as ms :refer [$ R]])

(def reactor (mr/create))
```

You can subscribe to events triggered within reactor by using `on`:

```clj
(mr/on reactor ($ "key") (fn [event]
                           # do work
                             ))
```

`($ "key")` here is a selector. In essence, that means that every time
reactor receives event dispatched with key `"key"`, it will call your
handler.

In order to push events into reactor, you can use `notify`:

```clj
(mr/notify reactor "key" {:my "payload"})
```

### Selectors

There're two types of selectors supported: exact match and regular
expression. Exact match should be used for cases when you want handler
to respond to the single key:

```clj
(mr/on reactor ($ "key") (fn [event] (do-one-thing event)))
(mr/on reactor ($ "key") (fn [event] (do-other-thing event)))
(mr/on reactor ($ "key") (fn [event] (do-something-else event)))

(mr/notify reactor "key" {:my :payload}) ;; will fire all three handlers
(mr/notify reactor "other" {:other :payload}) ;; will fire none
```

That means that all three handlers will receive a payload.

Regular expression selectors are used whenever you want to match one or
many event keys based on some pattern, for example:

```clj
(mr/on reactor (R "USA.*") (fn [event] (usa-handler event)))
(mr/on reactor (R "Europe.*") (fn [event] (europe-handler event)))
(mr/on reactor (R "Europe.Sw*") (fn [event] (sw-handler event)))

(mr/notify reactor "USA.EastCoast" {:teh :payload}) ;; will fire USA.*
(mr/notify reactor "Europe.Germany" {:das :payload}) ;; will fire Europe.*
(mr/notify reactor "Europe.Sweden" {:das :payload}) ;; will Europe.Sw* and Europe.* handlers
(mr/notify reactor "Europe.Switzerland" {:das :payload}) ;; will Europe.Sw* and Europe.* handlers
(mr/notify reactor "Asia.China" {:teh :payload}) ;; will fire none
```

### Routing Strategies

Whenever you have more than a single handler attached for selector, you
can define a routing strategy:

 * `:first` routing strategy will take a first handler for which
   selector matches key
 * `:broadcast` will dispatch event to every handler whose selector
   matches key
 * `:round-robin` on each run, will dispatch event to least recently
   used handler for which selector matches key. For example, if there're
   three handlers, first event will get to first, second - to second,
   third - to third, fourth - to first again and so on.

You can chose a routing strategy that makes most sense for your
application. `:first` is usually used when there should be a guarantee
that a single, first-assigned handler should take care of
event. `:broadcast` makes sense when all handlers should get an event
simultaneously, and perform different actions. And `:round-robin` would
make sense for things like load-balancing, whenever you would like to
keep all workers equally busy, therefore giving the one that just
received an event a chance to take care of it before it gets the next one.

In order to chose a routing strategy, pass one of the mentioned values
to `create` function, for example:

```clj
(mr/create :event-routing-strategy :broadcast)
```

### Dispatchers

There are several types of dispatchers, providing you a toolkit for both
threadpool-style long-running execution to high-throughput task
dispatching.

  * default one, syncronous dispatcher, implementation that dispatches
    events using the calling thread.
  * `:event-loop` dispatcher implementation that dispatches events using
    the single dedicated thread. Together with default syncronous dispatcher, 
    very useful in development mode.
  * `:thread-pool` dispatcher implementation that uses
    `ThreadPoolExecution` with an unbounded queue to dispatch
    events. Works best for long-running tasks.
  * `:ring-buffer` dispatcher implementation that uses LMAX Disruptor
    RingBuffer to queue tasks to execute. Known to be most
    high-througput implementation.


In order to create a reactor backed by the dispatched of your
preference, pass `:dispatcher-type` to `create` function, for example:

```clj
(mr/create :dispatcher-type :ring-buffer)
```

### Request/response Pattern

It is possible to receive get a callback from the callee. In order to
implement request-response with callback, use `send-event`
`receive-event` pair of methods.

`receive-event` is used instead of `notify` for performance
reasons. It's an expensive operation to check for `:respond-to` field
for each event. Result of the handler execution will be passed back to
the caller.

For example, if you'd like to send an event with `hello-key` key, execute a
callback function whenever response is received, you can do it that way:

```clj
;; Result of handler execution will be passed back to callback in send-event
(mr/receive-event reactor ($ "hello-key") (fn [_] "response"))

;; Sends "data" to "hello-key" and waits for handler to call back
(mr/send-event reactor "hello-key" "data" (fn [event]
                                            ;; do job with response
                                            ))
```

### Stream Processing

Two main concepts in stream processing are `channel` and `stream`. You
can publish information to `channel`, create arbitrary amount of streams
out of any `channel` or `stream`.

`stream` is a stateless event processor, that allows values that are
going through it to be filtered or changed. It's very easy to build
large processing graphs using this concept, since every mutation returns
another `stream` you can attach consumers to.

In order to compose streams, you can use `map*`, `filter*`, `reduce*`
and `batch*` functions. They have signatures similar to the ones you're
used to have in clojure. Applying `map*` with `inc` function on the
channel will create a new `stream` that contains all the values
incremented by one.

### `map*` operation

For example, let's create a channel where we push integers, and two
streams with attached consumers that would calculate incremented and
decremented values for incoming ints:

```clj
(ns :my-streams
  (:use clojurewerkz.meltdown.streams))

(def channel (create)) ;; creates a channel

(def incremented-values (map* inc channel))
(def decremented-values (map* dec channel))

(consume incremented-values (fn [i] (println "Incremented value: " i)))
(consume decremented-values (fn [i] (println "Decremented value: " i)))

(accept channel 1)
;; => "Incremented value: 2
;; => "Decremented value: 0
(accept channel 2)
;; => "Incremented value: 3
;; => "Decremented value: 1
(accept channel 3)
;; => "Incremented value: 4
;; => "Decremented value: 2
```

You can also apply `map*` to streams that were already "mapped", reduced
filtered or batched:

```clj
(def channel (create))

(def incremented-values (map* inc channel))
(def squared-values (map* (fn [i] (* i i) incremented-values)))

(consume squared-values (fn [i] (println "Incremented and squared value: " i)))

(accept channel 1)
;; => Incremented and squared value: 4
(accept channel 2)
;; => Incremented and squared value: 9
```

### `filter*` operation

`filter*` would filter values that go through it and only pass ones for
which predicate matches further:

```clj
(def channel (create))

(def even-numbers (filter* even? channel))
(def odd-numbers  (filter* odd? channel))

(consume even-values (fn [i] (println "Got an even value: " i)))
(consume odd-values (fn [i] (println "Got an odd value: " i)))

(accept channel 1)
;; => Got an odd value: 1
(accept channel 2)
;; => Got an even value: 2
(accept channel 3)
;; => Got an odd value: 3
(accept channel 4)
;; => Got an even value: 4
```

### `reduce*` operation

`reduce*` works pretty much same way as `reduce` in clojure works,
except for it gets values from the stream and holds last accumulator
value:

```clj
(def channel (create))

(def res (atom nil))

(def sum (reduce* #(+ %1 %2) 0 channel)
(consume sum #(reset! res %))

(accept channel 1)
(accept channel 2)
(accept channel 3)

@res ;; => 6
```

### `batch*` operation

For buffered operations, for example, when you'd like to have several
values batched together, and only bundled values are of interest for
you, you can use `batch*` that only emits values when buffer capacity is
reached and buffer is flushed.

### Custom streams

If these four given operations are not enough for you and you'd like to
create a custom stream, it's quite easy as welll. For that, there's a
`custom-stream` operation available. For example, you'd like to create
a stream that will only dispatch every 5th value further. For state,
you can use let-over-lamda:

```clj
(defn every-fifth-stream
  "Defines a stream that will receive all events from upstream and dispatch
   every fifth event further down"
  [upstream]
  (let [counter (atom 0)]
    (custom-stream
     (fn [event downstream]
       (swap! counter inc)
       (when (= 5 @counter)
         (reset! counter 0)
         (accept downstream event)))
     upstream)))
```

You can use custom streams same way as you usually use internal ones:

```clj
(def channel (create))

(def result (atom nil))

(def incrementer (map* inc channel)
(def inst-every-fifth-stream (every-fifth-stream incrememter))
(consume inst-every-fifth-stream #(reset! res %))

(accept channel 1) ;; @res is still `nil`
(accept channel 2) ;; @res is still `nil`
(accept channel 3) ;; @res is still `nil`
(accept channel 4) ;; @res is still `nil`
(accept channel 5)
@res ;; => 6
```

### Building declarative graphs

You can also build processing graphs in a declarative manner. For example,
let's create a graph that will increment all incoming values, then aggregate
a sum of them and put that sum to atom.

For these examples, you should use `clojurewerkz.meltdown.stream-graph` namespace
instead of usual `streams` one.

```clj
(ns my-stream-graphs-ns
  (:use clojurewerkz.meltdown.stream-graph))

(def res (atom nil))

(def channel (graph (create)
                    (map* inc
                          (reduce* #(+ %1 %2) 0
                                   (consume #(reset! res %))))))

(accept channel 1)
(accept channel 2)
(accept channel 3)

@res
;; => 9
```

### Attaching and detaching graph parts

If you see that your graph is too deeply nested, and you'd like to split it
in parts, you can use `attach` and `detach` functions. For example, here's
a graph that will increment each incoming value and calculate sums of
even and odd values separately:

```clj
(let [even-sum (atom nil)
      odd-sum (atom nil)
      even-summarizer (detach
                       (filter* even?
                                (reduce* #(+ %1 %2) 0
                                         (consume #(reset! even-sum %)))))

      odd-summarizer (detach
                      (filter* odd?
                               (reduce* #(+ %1 %2) 0
                                        (consume #(reset! odd-sum %)))))
      summarizer #(+ %1 %2)
      channel (graph (create)
                     (map* inc
                           (attach even-summarizer)
                           (attach odd-summarizer)))]

  (accept channel 1)
  (accept channel 2)
  (accept channel 3)
  (accept channel 4)

  @even-sum
  ;; => 6

  @odd-sum
  ;; => 8
  )
```

## Practical applications

You can use `reactor` for all kinds of events in your systems. Event can
represent an error, alarm or some other piece of information another
part of system should be aware of. Reactor calls do not block, therefore
should be used in cases when you'd like to fire-and-forget the event.

Using reactive approach has it's advantages, for example, if you're
responding to TCP socket connection, you can dispatch an event to
reactor, continue listening and be certain that a worker will pick it up
and take care of it.

You should be aware of the fact that if your handlers never finish (for
example, there's an endless loop inside one of handlers), you'll
eventually run out of available handlers, and won't be able to proceed.

## Performance

Throughput tests are included. They're formed in same exact way
Reactor's throughput tests are done, therefore you can compare outputs
directly. Overhead is insignificant.
